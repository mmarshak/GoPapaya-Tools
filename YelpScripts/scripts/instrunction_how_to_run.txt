The flags are -
* PRODUCTION_DB 0 or 1 , indicate is we run against the test DB or prodution DB
* ACTIVE_RUN    0 or 1 , indicate if this a passive run or an active run that will change the restaurant object
* RATING_UPDATE 0 or 1 , should we update the restaurant yelp rating. If it is 0, and the restaurant have allready a yelp business ID then we skip updating the restaurant object.
                         If it is 1 , we will update the yelp Rating as well the yelp business id.
